# Iterate the given list of numbers and print only those numbers which are divisible by 5

# Pseudocode

# Paste the given list
given_list =  [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]

# Print the given list
print("Given List is ", str(given_list)[1:-1])
# Print divisible by 5
# Create a for loop to determine the number in list that is divisible by 5
